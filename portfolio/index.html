                                    Our project is a tabletop game inspired by the party game Beer Pong. The game requires two players to stand at opposing ends of the table. Each person takes turns throwing a ping pong ball into the opposing player’s cups. Whenever a player lands a ball
                                    in a cup, that cup gets eliminated. This is indicated by two LEDs that change from green to red. This continues on until one player loses all their cups. To reset the game, players can remove the balls from the cups
                                    and tap a touch sensor. There is also a temperature sensor on the side to measure how cold the player’s drink is.
                                </p>

                                <h2 class="project-steps">Work Description</h2>
                                <p class="project-step-detail">When creating the project, we all collectively agreed that we wanted to do some sort of game involving the sensor interaction. There wasn’t very much brainstorming in this process as we stuck with the first idea that we
                                    landed on, which was beer pong. Our initial concept was to have 3 modes of interaction with the sensors. A touch sensor would be used to change between game modes, a temperature sensor would be intended to read the
                                    drink temperature, and 3 Infrared distance sensors would be set up along each of the cups to detect when a ball lands.
                                </p>
                                <img class="project-images" src="img/BPE_2.png" alt="beerpong-skethces">

                                <p class="project-step-detail">However, in the prototype, we repurposed the touch sensor to reset the game, and we used Ultrasonic distance sensors instead of Infrared for better detection. Also, our original plan was to have either 6 cups on one end
                                    of the table, or sets of three on both ends of the table, but due to a lack of sensors at the time, and lack of ports on a single arduino RedBoard, we decided to just have 3 cups on one end to test it’s functionality.
                                    We constructed a holder for the three cups to sit in, which also helped hold the sensors and 1 LEDs in place, with a small hatch to hold the arduino red board and breadboard. We made the addition of the temperature
                                    sensor to add another mode of interaction for those playing the game.

                                <p class="project-step-detail">For the prototype, we built a casing out of foam board to hold the 3 cups, as well as the 3 ultrasonic sensors and sets of LEDs for each cup. The ultrasonic sensors were used to detect ball movement whenever a ball should
                                    make it into a cup; each sensor was set up to it’s own respective cup. The touch sensor was used to reset the game when one player loses all their cups. In other words, it changes the lights from red back to green.
                                    Each ultrasonic sensor was paired with 1 red and green LED. The temperature sensor was used as an additional interaction where players could place their drinks on top of the sensor to determine how cold their drink
                                    is.

                                <h2 class="project-steps">Prototype & Challenges</h2>
                                <p class="project-step-detail">One of the main challenges we had was cable management. With so many sensors connected to one breadboard and with nearly all the ports filled up on the Arduino RedBoard, it became difficult to tell which connection led
                                    where. The space these cables took up also proved to be a challenge for hiding the components inside the casing we created for the cups. Unfortunately, for the prototype, we were unable to hide the wires adequately,
                                    but this would have been worked around for the final product.</p>
                                <img class="project-images" src="img/BPE_5.png" alt="beerbong-prototype">
                                <p class="project-step-detail last-image">Another challenge we had was getting the ultrasonic distance sensors to detect when the ball entered the cup. The reason this was challenging was because once the ball got in the cup it would be out of the sensors range.
                                    We solved the problem by having our code change the LED green to red as soon as the sensor notices a change in range. This way the ball wouldn’t have to constantly be in the sensor’s range to be able to notice the ball
                                    landed in the cup. These were a couple of problems we faced with our prototype.
